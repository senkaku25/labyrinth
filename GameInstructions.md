# Game Instructions

Below is the instructions for **Labyrinth**

## General

* The **player** is spawned to a location in a **maze** of unknown size and shape.
* The player has a **revolver**, **bullet(s)**, and one **extra life**. 
* The maze is organized by a Cartesian system (a 2-dimensional grid).
* Unexplored areas appear dark.

## Objective

* A **treasure** and an **exit** is located within the maze. 
* The *goal* of the game is to collect the treasure and exit the labyrinth.
* If both lives are lost, the player loses.  
* If the player reaches the exit with the treasure, then the player wins.

## Monsters

* **Mirrors** and **minotaurs** are spawned in the maze.
* Both Mirrors and minotaurs appear as eyes in dark areas. 
* Mirrors will not harm the player.
* Minotaurs kill the player if the minotaur is not shot.

## Combat

A player can choose to *shoot a bullet* or *hold their fire* at eyes in dark areas.

Additional bullets can be found in the maze.  

**Shooting eyes**
* If the player shoots a mirror, the mirror will crack and the bullet will be wasted.
* If the player shoots a minotaur, the minotaur will be killed and the player will be saved.
* If the player does not shoot a mirror, nothing happens.
* If the player does not shoot a minotaur, the minotaur will kill the player.

## Lives

The player's extra life allows the player to respawn again with more bullets. The player respawns in a randomized spot in the maze.
